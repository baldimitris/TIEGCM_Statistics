# TIEGCM_Statistics

## Introduction
The project reads TIE-GCM result files, separates the data into bins and calculates percentiles for each bin. These can be plotted as altitude profiles afterwards. Created for a study which compared TIE-GCM with Tromso EISCAT radar for the 11-year solar cycle 24 .
