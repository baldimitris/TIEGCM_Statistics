# TIEGCM_Statistics
This repository contains the software which executed the statistical calculations for:
<em>
&emsp;A comparative assessment of the distribution of Joule heating in altitude as estimated in TIE-GCM and EISCAT over one solar cycle.

## Introduction
The project reads TIE-GCM result files, separates the data into bins and calculates percentiles for each bin. These can be plotted as altitude profiles afterwards. Created for a study which compared TIE-GCM with Tromso EISCAT radar for the 11-year solar cycle 24 .

## Data
The data for this project originate from two sources: a TIE-GCM 11 year simulation for the whole duration of the solar cycle 24 and several campaigns of the Tromso EISCAT Incoherent Scatter Radar during the same period. 
The TIEGCM_DATA folder contains sample data files from the TIE-GCM model and the EISCAT_DATA folder contains the altitude profiles as caluclated based on the radar data.
